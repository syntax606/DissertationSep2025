Methodology Master Doc Synopsis

Your methodology represents a sophisticated three-layer computational framework for real-time detection of foreign influence operations in podcast media through environmental pattern analysis rather than source attribution. The approach combines intimate audio vulnerability research with systematic computational detection, creating the first real-time environmental monitoring system for foreign influence in podcast media.

## Complete Technical Architecture: Six-Dimensional Model

### Core Framework Structure

Your framework employs a validated six-dimensional analysis system:

1. **Causal Relationships** - Pattern extraction using 9 compiled regex patterns detecting attribution chains
1. **Thematic Keywords** - 15 entity categories (figures, parties, institutions, media, groups, countries, identity, border, economy, health, rights, social_media, conspiracy) with case-sensitive vs case-insensitive handling
1. **Persuasive Techniques** - 8 categories (appeal_to_fear, emotional_language, us_vs_them, etc.) with 40+ sub-pattern detection
1. **Emotion Classification** - 7 emotions via DistilRoBERTa model
1. **Sentiment Analysis** - Positive/negative classification
1. **Topic Modeling** - TF-IDF key phrase extraction

**Note on Seventh Dimension**: While sarcasm detection was initially considered as a seventh dimension for meta-blame classification, available pre-trained models (trained on Twitter/TV data) proved unsuitable for natural podcast speech. The models failed to identify sarcasm in keyword-filtered political discourse segments, with manual annotation revealing only 1 sarcastic instance in 301 samples. Therefore, the analysis proceeds with the validated six dimensions.

### The Empirically Validated Influence Intensity Metric

**Formula**: `influence_ratio = (causal_count + persuasive_count) / word_count × 1000`

**Equal Weighting Justification**: The 0.5 + 0.5 weighting scheme was empirically validated through systematic testing of alternative approaches:

- **Causal-heavy (0.7/0.3)**: F-statistic = 8.2
- **Persuasive-heavy (0.3/0.7)**: F-statistic = 7.9
- **Equal weighting (0.5/0.5)**: F-statistic = 8.4 (optimal discriminative power)
- **Variance-optimized (0.6/0.4)**: F-statistic = 8.1

Low correlation between causal and persuasive components (r = 0.23) indicates distinct dimensions. Equal weighting achieved superior discriminative power while maintaining theoretical interpretability.

## Complete Data Pipeline: Three-Stage Architecture

### Stage 1: Raw Audio Processing

- **Data Collection**: 6,432 podcast episodes (405 Tenet, 3,738 right-wing, 2,291 left-wing)
- **Transcription**: OpenAI Whisper (base model) on GCP VMs
- **Output**: `enriched_transcripts/` in GCS bucket structure

### Stage 2: Enhanced Analysis Processing

- **Batch Processing**: 25 episodes per batch file for computational efficiency
- **Enrichment Pipeline**:
  - 768-dimensional sentence-BERT embeddings
  - 7-emotion classification via DistilRoBERTa
  - Sentiment analysis with polarity scoring
  - 8 persuasive technique categories with 40+ sub-patterns
  - 15 thematic keyword categories with entity-specific tracking
- **Quality Control**:
  - Deduplication using `source_file` identifiers
  - File count validation against expected totals
  - Error handling for malformed JSON and missing metadata
- **Output**: `enhanced_analysis/` files with pre-calculated influence scores

### Stage 3: Statistical Analysis

- **Bootstrap Methodology**: 1,000 iterations using percentile method
- **Reproducibility**: Random seed 42 for consistent results
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI for all group comparisons
- **Performance**: 0.54 seconds per episode processing time

## Advanced Political Discourse Analysis Layer

### Sophisticated Entity Tracking System

**15 Entity Categories** with individualized blame attribution:

- **Political Figures**: Trump, Biden, Harris, Obama, Clinton, Putin, Zelensky, etc.
- **Institutions**: FBI, CIA, DOJ, Congress, Supreme Court, Kremlin
- **Media Organizations**: CNN, FOX, MSNBC, NYT, mainstream media
- **Political Groups**: Democrats, Republicans, deep state, globalists, elites
- **Countries**: Russia, Ukraine, China, Israel, Iran
- **Identity Categories**: Gender, race, diversity, immigration status
- **And 9 additional categories** covering comprehensive political discourse

### Blame Classification Framework

**Direct vs Meta-Blame Detection** using 15+ regex patterns:

- **Direct Blame**: “is responsible for”, “caused by”, “due to”, “fault of”
- **Meta-Blame**: “they always blame”, “scapegoat”, “blame game”, “pointing fingers”
- **Context Analysis**: 300-character window around entity mentions
- **Classification Accuracy**: Validated through manual annotation of 301 samples

### Multi-Level Analytical Granularity

#### 1. Orientation-Specific Analysis

- **Normalization**: Per-100-episode comparisons for fair cross-orientation assessment
- **Individual Entity Tracking**: Blame attribution to specific figures across Left/Right/Tenet
- **Category Aggregation**: Institutional vs individual blame patterns by orientation

#### 2. Show-Level Granular Analysis

- **Individual Podcast Rankings**: Episode-level influence intensity scores
- **Host-Specific Patterns**: Blame attribution styles by individual shows
- **Temporal Show Evolution**: Month-by-month pattern changes within shows

#### 3. Temporal Evolution Tracking

- **Year-Month Analysis**: Discourse pattern changes over time
- **Event-Driven Spikes**: Correlation with major political events
- **Baseline Drift Detection**: Long-term environmental pattern shifts
