BOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FROM ENHANCED ANALYSIS DATA
==========================================================

Data Source: Enhanced analysis files containing pre-calculated influence scores
Analysis Date: 20250812_144030
Random Seed: 42 (for reproducibility)

Episode Counts:
  Tenet Media: n = 405
  US Left-wing: n = 2291
  US Right-wing: n = 3741
  Total: n = 6437

Influence Score Calculation:
  Formula: (causal_count + persuasive_count) / word_count × 1000
  Where:
    - causal_count = regex-matched causal patterns
    - persuasive_count = keyword-matched persuasive techniques
    - Normalized per 1000 words

Bootstrap Results (1000 iterations):

Tenet Media:
  Mean: 5.454 (95% CI: [5.218, 5.700])
  n = 405
US Left-wing:
  Mean: 4.782 (95% CI: [4.720, 4.844])
  n = 2291
US Right-wing:
  Mean: 5.684 (95% CI: [5.630, 5.737])
  n = 3741

Right vs Left difference: 0.902 (95% CI: [0.821, 0.987])

Amplification Factors (relative to Tenet baseline):
  Right-wing: 1.042× (95% CI: [1.033×, 1.052×])
  Left-wing: 0.877× (95% CI: [0.865×, 0.888×])

All confidence intervals calculated using percentile bootstrap method.
